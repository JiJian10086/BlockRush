### Introduction — When Tower Defense Meets Blockchain, and Coding Meets "Chatting"

Developing a Tower Defense (TD) game might not be inherently difficult. However, creating a game that visualizes hardcore blockchain concepts while relying entirely on Natural Language (NL) interaction for its development process was a challenging experiment.

_Block Rush_ is the result of this experiment. With the support of the ModelScope Creative Space, we utilized the KiRo platform to explore a new development paradigm where logic is defined not by hand-coding, but by dialogue.

### 1. Game Concept — The "Gamification" of Hardcore Tech

The core gameplay of _Block Rush_ is not just about building towers to destroy monsters. To pay homage to blockchain technology, we introduced a dual mechanism emphasizing both Defense and Passage.

- **Red Units (Malicious Attacks)** must be eliminated.
- **Green Units (Legitimate Transactions)** must be allowed to pass, as accidental damage results in a penalty.

This mechanism forces players to be extremely careful with their layout, preventing the mindless spamming of AOE (Area of Effect) damage. Furthermore, every unit in the game maps to a blockchain concept.

**Towers as Tools**  
The **Validator** serves as the basic tower representing Asymmetric Encryption for basic verification. The **L2 Channel** is a laser tower representing Layer 2 Scaling Solutions, specifically designed to counter enemies with health regeneration. The **Mainnet Cannon** acts as the ultimate ability representing a "Hard Fork," which is a manual bombardment of the entire map designed to deal with BOSS units.

**Enemies as Threats**  
The **Double Spending Attack** appears as a stealth mob requiring a "Smart Contract Gate" (True Sight) to be targeted. The **51% Attack** is the BOSS unit with massive health and damage, requiring the "Mainnet Cannon" (Consensus Power) to counter.

This design transforms cold technical terminology into vivid strategic gameplay.

### 2. KiRo Development Log — Coding via "Documentation"

This project was more than just game development. It was a stress test for KiRo’s Natural Language (NL) interaction capabilities.

The traditional workflow involves Ideation, Writing Code, Debugging, and Refactoring. In _Block Rush_, we adopted a new workflow consisting of NL Requirement, KiRo Generated Specs, Chat Iteration, and Module Implementation.

#### A. Core Highlight — NL-Driven Logic Iteration

When developing the "L2 Channel" tower, we didn't start by writing `LaserTower.cs` or JS. Our interaction with KiRo followed a specific path.

First, we stated that we needed a defense tower corresponding to the Layer 2 concept featuring continuous laser damage and suppression of enemy health regeneration. Second, KiRo generated a technical document defining the damage frequency, suppression Debuff duration, and visual logic. Third, we realized the document ignored the "Legitimate Transaction" logic, so we told KiRo to add logic ensuring the laser would not damage units tagged as "Legitimate." Finally, once the document was verified, KiRo drove the code generation.

The benefit of this "Document-Driven" approach is astounding. It prevents the "spaghetti code" that often results from impromptu coding because all logic is verified at the conceptual level via natural language before a single line of code is written.

#### B. Even AI Understands Strategy

What surprised us most was KiRo's grasp of concepts. When we mentioned that the "Mixer" enemy should have "Transaction Obfuscation" properties, KiRo suggested giving it a high-damage reduction shield. This aligns perfectly with the real-world concept of Mixers protecting privacy by making transactions hard to "break." This AI-assisted design significantly enriched the game details.

### 3. Practical Results — A 15-Minute Flow State

Currently, the _Block Rush_ Demo is deployed in the ModelScope Creative Space. Practical testing data highlights several key outcomes.

**Stability**  
Thanks to the standardized code generated by KiRo, the game runs smoothly without critical bugs, demonstrating high stability.

**Strategic Depth**  
The counter-play chains—such as "L2 Channel" countering "High-Frequency Trading Regen Mobs" and "ZK Sniper" countering "Mixer Armored Mobs"—function perfectly.

This proves that the development method based on KiRo and NL interaction is fully capable of supporting the rapid prototyping of complex strategy games.

### 4. Outlook — When KiRo Meets ModelScope's Model Library

The final draft of _Block Rush_ is just the beginning. Leveraging the ModelScope ecosystem, we plan to introduce more "magic" in the future.

1. **AI Dynamic Balancing** — We aim to integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) models to dynamically adjust enemy health and wave composition based on player performance in the first 5 minutes.
2. **Generative Assets** — We plan to integrate Text-to-Image models to make the "Mainnet Cannon" effects even more spectacular.
3. **Intelligent Wiki** — We want to integrate LLMs to automatically generate an encyclopedia for every tower and enemy in the game based on real-world blockchain knowledge, adding educational value.

### Conclusion

Developing _Block Rush_ made us realize that the role of the programmer is shifting. Using KiRo, we felt less like coders and more like Technical Directors or Product Managers. We no longer agonized over syntax details but focused on logical consistency and gameplay innovation.

If you want to experience the thrill of "building without typing," give KiRo a try, or visit ModelScope to play _Block Rush_.
